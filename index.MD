## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 5, part 1

  This was a favorite lab of mine because it was when I was first learning about printing something to the terminal and inputting an answer. In this lab I was able to implement the use of using the function std::cin to get a input from the user.

* Lab 7, part 1 

  This was one of my favorite labs because of the way we implemented rules of sorts to make it so only if certain conditions are met it makes it so in this situation someone can park there. In this lab I was able to write functions that made it so only under certain conditions a car would be able to park. 

* Lab 10, part 1 

  This was a favorite lab of mine because of how interesting it was learning how to retrieve specific information about counties from the list that holds it. In this lab I was able to use conditional statements to check if a county contains anything and if it did I used the += function to assign a value to the string.
